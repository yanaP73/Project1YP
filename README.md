### Deployment

This website was creating using Visual Studio Code, a local git directory was used for version control, and then uploaded 
to GitHub. I initiated the git repository with 'git innit', then used 'git status' to see which of my un-tracked files had not been added to the new repository. I used 'git commit -m "added in a specific message" to commit my changed files to the repository. Once my files were committed I uploaded  all the files to GitHub.
